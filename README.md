This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize facial expressions from grayscale images (48x48).
Trained on 7 emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprise) using Keras and TensorFlow.
Achieved 84% accuracy on test data after training with dropout and max pooling layers.
Deployed with Streamlit for real-time emotion prediction on uploaded images.
Includes data preprocessing, label encoding, model saving, and evaluation.
